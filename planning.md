[^1]: Remote attestation provides us with a demonstration that a given system is in a given state - ideally one where the integrity of the system is according to known good values.
Keeping a history of claims, results and decisions of a system over a longer period of time provides vital information about how a system is evolving over firmware and software changes, as well as potential hardware changes. Utilising this information can provide evidence of unwanted and unexpected changes to a system.
We present here a tool for attestation and forensics, through a simple example. Additionally we provide a case study from a potential firmware CVE and finally provide a case based upon Open Radio Access Network hardware.
